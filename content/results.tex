\chapter{Results}

We were able to implement \ac{UEFI} attacks in the form of a \ac{UEFI} firmware rootkit and a \ac{UEFI} bootloader rootkit (bootkit), with both being able to deploy Windows level payload from within the \ac{UEFI} environment using an \ac{NTFS} drivers.
Through our \ac{UEFI} port of the \program{reged} utility we were able to modify the Windows registry, so that our Windows payload is executed with the privileges of the built-in local system account.
The execution is done by the Task Scheduler at system boot.
With Secure Boot enabled we showed that our bootkit was denied execution, while the execution of our rootkit is left unaffected. Although affecting infection by restricting software access to the firmware image.
When BitLocker is used with a \ac{TPM} and the default validation profile \code{\{0, 2, 4, 11\}} our root- and bootkit trigger the BitLocker recovery prompt, from which we our \emph{BitLogger} was able to log entered keystrokes to obtain the recovery key. We were then able to use the recovery key with our \ac{UEFI} port of Dislocker to mount the encrypted drive, allowing us to repeat our initial attack of deploying payload and modifying the registry.
In the case of our \ac{UEFI} payload being part of the \ac{TPM} measurements used to encrypt the \ac{VMK} or when a validation profile is used that does not include \ac{PCR}0, we were able to sniff the communication between the \ac{TPM} and the Windows Boot Manager to retrieve the unencrypted \ac{VMK} for use with Dislocker.
We showed that this is the case when using a Secure Boot configuration that uses only Microsoft's signature \ac{DB} required to boot Windows. This forces a default validation profile of \code{\{7, 11\}}, leaving out \ac{PCR}0.
Our rootkit attack was able to gain access to this type of system without requiring any prior knowledge or additional user input.
