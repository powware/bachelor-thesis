\chapter{Attacks}
\label{sec:attacks}

We implement our own storage-based \ac{UEFI} attacks in the form of a bootkit and a rootkit and test them against our setups using three different escalating levels of security.
The first attack uses standard Windows security policies that are to be expected after a fresh manual installation, Secure Boot and BitLocker are disabled.
For the second attack we enable Secure Boot and for the third attack we enable \ac{BDE} with \ac{TPM} protection for Windows.
