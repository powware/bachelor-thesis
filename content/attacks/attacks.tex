% chapter summary, briefly introduce the three attacks
We implement our own storage based UEFI attacks in three different scenarios with increasing levels of security mechanisms. The first is with Secure Boot and Bitlocker disabled, the second is with Secure Boot enabled and the third is both Secure Boot and Bitlocker enabled with the focus of the attack on Bitlocker.
