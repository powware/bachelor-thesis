\chapter{Attacks}

% chapter summary, briefly introduce the three attacks
We implement our own storage-based \ac{UEFI} attacks in three different scenarios with increasing levels of security mechanisms. The first attack is with Secure Boot and BitLocker disabled, the second attack with Secure Boot enabled and the third attack with both Secure Boot and BitLocker enabled with the focus of the attack on BitLocker.

%  aims of the attacks
