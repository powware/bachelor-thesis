\chapter{Attacks}
\label{sec:attacks}

We implement our storage-based \ac{UEFI} attacks in the form of a bootkit and a rootkit and test them against our setups using three different escalating levels of security.
The first attack uses standard Windows security policies that are to be expected after a fresh manual installation, i.e., Secure Boot and BitLocker are disabled.
For the second attack, we enable Secure Boot and for the third attack, we enable Windows \ac{BDE} using a \ac{TPM} to protect the \ac{VMK}.
