% how does one enable it
mostly comes with default keys OEM
expectation:
not to boot
observation:
doesnt boot

add DXE Drivers to the DXE Volume.
% how to achieve assumption/requirement
This can be achieved by having read/write access to the SPI flash or using the Signed Capsule Update. Gaining read/write access to the SPI Flash is possible either through physical access to the device by using an SPI clamp on the chip itself or through exploits like for example the
% see SMM multi threaded exploit
. Signed Capsule Updates can be leveraged with access to private vendor information by signing the payload to make it appear legitimate or by intercepting the distribution process and employing infected firmware.

% network boot maybe
