\chapter{\acs{UEFI}/\acs{PI}}

\textcquote{uefi-spec-overview}{The \ac{UEFI} specifications define a new model for the interface between personal-computer \ac{OS} and \ac{PF}. \textelp{} Together, these provide a standard environment for booting an \ac{OS} and running pre-boot applications}.
The specifications making up this model are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \ac{ACPI} Specification
    \item \ac{UEFI} Specification
    \item \ac{UEFI} Shell Specification
    \item \ac{UEFI} \ac{PI} Specification
    \item \ac{UEFI} \ac{PI} Distribution Packaging Specification
    \item \ac{TCG} \ac{EFI} Platform Specification
    \item \ac{TCG} \ac{EFI} Protocol Specification
\end{itemize}

We make an effort to keep a clear distinction as to what is defined in which specification.

The \ac{UEFI} specification itself is a pure interface specification, describing the programmatic interface for interaction with the \ac{PF}, merely stating what interfaces and structures a \ac{PF} has to offer and what an \ac{OS} may use \cite{beyond-bios}.

build system
at least mention that local gcc is used, relevant for porting and headers

BaseTools package process files compiled by third party tools, as well as text and Unicode files in order to create UEFI or PI compliant binary image files
