\subsubsection{Hardware Validated Boot}
Secure Boot relies for the firmware as its root of trust, hardware validated boot shifts this trusts out of the firmware image into hardware.

\subsubsection{Firmware Protection}

The \ac{DXE} phase also offers drivers to register notification
% End of Dxe Event
% From SEC through the signaling of this event, all of the components should be under the authority of
% the platform manufacturer and not have to worry about interaction or corruption by 3rd party
% extensible modules such as UEFI drivers and UEFI applications.

% Platform may choose to lock certain resources or disable certain interfaces prior to executing third
% party extensible modules. Transition from the environment where all of the components are under
% the authority of the platform manufacturer to the environment where third party modules are
% executed is a two-step process:

% 1. End of DXE Event is signaled. This event presents the last opportunity to use resources or
% interfaces that are going to be locked or disabled in anticipation of the invocation of 3rd party
% extensible modules.
% 2. DXE SMM Ready to Lock Protocol is installed. PI modules that need to lock or protect their
% resources in anticipation of the invocation of 3rd party extensible modules should register for
% notification on installation of this protocol and effect the appropriate protections in their
% notification handlers
