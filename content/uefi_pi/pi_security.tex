\subsection{Security}

\subsubsection{Hardware Validated Boot}
Secure Boot relies for the firmware as its root of trust, hardware validated boot shifts this trusts out of the firmware image into hardware.

% what is TPM
A \acf{TPM} is a system component which enables trust in computing platforms
helps verify if the Trusted Computing Base has been compromised
securely storing passwords, certificates and encryption keys in separate state to host
only communicating through a well defined interface.
store platform measurements that help ensure that the platform remains trustworthy
authentication
attestation
hardware and software implementations
software special mode shielding TPM resources from normal execution

\cite{tcg-tpm-library-part1-architecture}

% what is done with the measurements
% https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-overview
how are they used
works with bitlocker to protect user data
ensure computer has not been tampered with while offline

% what is measured
statically configured, unchangeable data
not dynamic and changeable across the boot,
