recovery guide

what causes bitlocker recovery
- password wrong too often
- TPM 1.2, changing the BIOS or firmware boot device order
- Having the CD or DVD drive before the hard drive in the BIOS boot order and then inserting or removing a CD or DVD
- Failing to boot from a network drive before booting from the hard drive.
- Docking or undocking a portable computer
- Changes to the NTFS partition table on the disk including creating, deleting, or resizing a primary partition.
- Entering the personal identification number (PIN) incorrectly too many times
- Upgrading critical early startup components, such as a BIOS or UEFI firmware upgrade
- Updating option ROM firmware graphics card
- Adding or removing hardware
- REMOVING, INSERTING, OR COMPLETELY DEPLETING THE CHARGE ON A SMART BATTERY ON A PORTABLE COMPUTER
- Pressing the F8 or F10 key during the boot process

\section{Rootkit classification}

statisken zu bilocker und secureboot auf systemen

industrie standard zur system security in firmen

\section{Mitigations}

hardware validated boot

inaccessible spi flash

tpm + pin detectability

googeln wie legitime recovery key prompt reaktion aussieht

enterprise policy recovery key einschraenkbar?

enterprise policy on recovery key loss


\subsection{User awareness}

vermitteln was das prompt bedeuten koennte

aber kann man einfach nicht anzeigen lassen

Security Flaw of entering a Recovery Password in an inheritly unsafe System

enterprise doesnt hand out recovery keys and instead receives hard drive


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
without hardware chain of trust a compromised system can patch/change any software and fixes are impossible

phishing prompts on their own

\section{Future work}
exploit in tpm measruement chain that rsults in not being measured
can exploit the tg2 hook directly to retrieve the vmk
