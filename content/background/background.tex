\chapter{Background}

The following introduces the background information necessary to understand the employment of a \ac{UEFI} rootkit. This includes the general workings of the \acf{PI} and \ac{UEFI}, the \ac{UEFI} programming model and interface itself; as well as its security mechanisms. It is also necessary to understand our target's defenses, for this, we briefly describe the Window's security mechanisms faced when performing our attacks.
