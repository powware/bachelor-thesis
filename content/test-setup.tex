\chapter{Test Setup}
\label{sec:test-setup}

We perform our attacks against Windows 11 on three different setups, as even though all three \ac{UEFI} firmwares used, are \cite{pi-spec} compliant, there still are many things left up to the \acp{OEM} to decide, when implementing a firmware image.

\section{\acs{QEMU}}
\label{sec:test-setup:qemu}

Our main development setup is an emulated environment using the emulator \ac{QEMU} \cite{qemu} together with the \ac{OVMF} image, from \ac{EDK} II (\lstinline{edk2-stable202208}).
For Secure Boot we generate our own \ac{PK} and use the \emph{Microsoft Corporation \acs{KEK} \acsu{CA} 2011} as \ac{KEK} and the two signature \acp{DB} \emph{Microsoft Windows Production PCA 2011} and \emph{Microsoft Corporation UEFI CA 2011} from Microsoft.
In the attacks against BitLocker we use \emph{swtpm} for the emulation of a software \ac{TPM} \cite{swtpm}. Accessing the firmware image with this setup is just done through simple file access.

This can be done by using a spi flash programmer and clamping the physical chip. \TODO{FLASHROM}
