\section{\acs{UEFI}}

\subsection{Installation}

For us to understand how UEFI threats act towards Windows we need to understand how the layout of the Windows installation integrates into the UEFI environment.
% uefi begins with windows installation
This begins with the installation process and the partitioning of the hard drive Windows is installed onto.
% creates at least four partitions
When the Windows Installer is launched, it creates at least four partitions on the target hard drive.
The \acf{ESP}, a recovery partition, a partition reserved for temporary storage and the boot partition containing the system files.
Two copies of the Windows Boot Manager \lstinline{bootmgfw.efi} are placed on the \ac{ESP}, one under \lstinline{EFI\\Boot\\bootx64.efi} for the default boot behavior the installed hard drive and one under \lstinline{EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\bootmgfw.efi} alongside boot resources such as the \ac{BCD}.
The path of the latter boot manager is saved in a boot load option variable entry \lstinline{Boot####}, which is then added to the \lstinline{BootOrder} list variable.
The boot load option contains optional data consiting of a GUID identifying the Windows Boot Manager entry in the \ac{BCD}.
The \ac{BCD}, as its name suggests, contains arguments used to configure various steps of the boot process \cite[Section 12]{windows-internals-7-part2}.
The boot partition is the primary Windows partition and is formatted with the \ac{NTFS} file system containing the Windows installation.
This is also the location of the final step of the Windows UEFI boot process, \lstinline{Windload.efi}, the application repsonsible for loading the kernel into memory \cite[12. The Windows OS Loader]{windows-internals-7-part2}.

\subsection{Boot}

Now that we established the basic structure of the Windows UEFI boot environment, we can discuss the boot process.
The Windows boot process begins after the UEFI Boot Manager launches the Windows Boot Manager, which starts by retrieving its own executable path and the \ac{BCD} entry GUID from the boot load options.
Then it loads the \ac{BCD} and access its entry.
If not disabled in the \ac{BCD} it loads its own executable into memory for integrity verification \cite[Section 12]{windows-internals-7-part2}.
Depending on what hibernation status is set within the \ac{BCD} it may launch the \lstinline{Winresume.efi} application, which reads the hibernation file and resumes kernel execution \cite[Section 12]{windows-internals-7-part2}.
On a full boot it checks the \ac{BCD} for boot entries, if the entry points to a BitLocker encrypted drive, it attempts decryption.
If this fails it shows a recovery prompt, otherwise it proceeds to load the \lstinline{Windload.efi} \ac{OS} loader \cite[Section 12]{windows-internals-7-part2}.
\TODO{mention \lstinline{ntoskernel.exe}}

% tries to TPM unseal
% url and message are read from BCD
% if succeeds make sure TPM cant be used to unseal further things
% StartImage os loader, only returns in error case
% if so start Windows Recovery Sequence
\TODO{TPM interaction}
\cite[Section 12]{windows-internals-7-part2}

\subsection{Runtime}

During runtime Windows uses the variable services to communicate with the \ac{PF} and even exposes these to application developers.
It also supports firmware or option \ac{ROM} updates via the capsule delivery services.

\section{Registry}

A crucial part to the whole Windows ecosystem is the Registry, it is a system database containing information required to boot, such as what drivers to load, general system wide configuration as well as application configuration \cite[Section 1]{windows-internals-7-part1}.
The Registry is a hierachical database containing keys and values, keys can contain other keys or values, forming a tree structure.
Values store data through various data types.
It is comparable to a file system structure with keys behaving like directories and values like files \cite[Section 10]{windows-internals-7-part2}.
At the top level it has 9 different keys \cite[Section 10]{windows-internals-7-part2}.
Normally Windows users are not required to change Registry values directly and instead interact with it through applications providing setting abstractions.
Though some more advanced options may not be exposed and can be accessed through the \lstinline{regedit.exe} application which provides a graphical user interface to travere and modify the Registry \cite[Section 10]{windows-internals-7-part2}.
It also supports ex- and importing registry keys along their subkeys and contained values.
Internally the registry is not a single large file but instead a set of file called hives, each hive contains one tree, that is mapped into the Registry as a whole.
There is no one to one mapping of registry root key to hive file, the \ac{BCD} file for example is also a hive file and is mapped into the Registry under \lstinline{HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\BCD00000000} \cite[Section 10]{windows-internals-7-part2}.
Some hives even reside entirely in memory as a means of offering hardware configuration through the Registry \ac{API}.

\TODO{maybe fun fact that EFS cant encrypt hives}
windows also has a feature called Encrypting File System (EFS) with file system level encryption but it cant be used for registry hives
\cite[Section 9]{windows-internals-6-part2}
