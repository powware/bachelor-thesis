\chapter{Conclusion}

dxe runtime rootkit not rally feasible since it doesnt run without being called back by the os
dxe smm rootkit makes sense

\section{Achieved Goals}
when we are already in the image we can gain full control over the system
system cant be trusted anymore e.g. uefi services
full file access
escalate it to local system level execution
bitlocker has the flaw of allowing to enter criticial information into an inherently untrustable system
on the other hand one could force such a prompt themselves
mere exisitence of a recovery key is a security flaw

\section{Future Work}
tpm and pin
capsule update
exploit in tpm measruement chain that results in not being measured
can exploit the tg2 hook directly to retrieve the vmk
memory based rootkit
